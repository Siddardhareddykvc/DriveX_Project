## Overview
The **DriveX Assignment Submission** is a practical implementation of the assignment requirements, focusing on modularity, scalability, and code readability. The project enables users to upload XLSX files, process them, and ask questions based on the extracted content. AI is leveraged to answer these questions, providing a user-friendly experience while maintaining robust performance.

## Features
- **File Upload**: Allows users to upload Excel files (XLSX) for processing.
- **AI-powered Q&A**: Users can ask questions, and the AI will respond with relevant answers derived from the document content.
- **Validation and Error Handling**: Proper validation is applied to user inputs, ensuring smooth functionality and preventing errors.
- **Extensibility**: The code is modular, allowing easy future enhancements and improvements.
- **Optimized for Scalability**: Capable of handling large documents efficiently with proper optimization.

## Technologies
The project utilizes the following tools and technologies:
- **Programming Language**: Python / JavaScript (Node.js), depending on your choice.
- **Frameworks**:
  - **Frontend**: React.js, HTML5, CSS3 (or other preferred frameworks)
  - **Backend**: Flask (Python) or Express.js (Node.js)
  - **AI**: OpenAI API (or equivalent NLP service for Q&A)
- **Deployment**: Hosted on platforms such as AWS, Vercel, or Netlify for easy access.

### Key Changes:
1. Modified section titles slightly (e.g., "Technologies" instead of "Technologies Used").
2. Rephrased descriptions to ensure they’re distinct from the original.
3. Updated some phrasing to make it sound more personalized and less template-like.
4. Adjusted section ordering and structure for variety.

This should differentiate the text while still conveying all the necessary information! Let me know if you need any further tweaks.
